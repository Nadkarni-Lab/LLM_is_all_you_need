# LLM is all you need
This repo contains code for doing generation, extraction, prediction, retrieval, and evaluation tasks using LLMs. You can also find resources to start learning LLMs and use these codes as training material.

## ez: Easy Use of LLMs at Scale

"ez" refers to ready-to-use codes that you can create via UI application. A very bare minimum level of coding is needed. This includes:

- ✅ [ezExperimenter](https://github.com/Sdamirsa/ezExperimenter): experimenting with LLMs and VLMs, with or without structured output
- ✅ ezEXCT: Advanced extraction (failure prof)
- ⭕ ezFineTuner: Fine-tune LLMs (supports openai, as well as Firework for open-source models)
- ⭕ ezEvaluator: Using LLMs (as-a-judge) for evaluation with either criteria or examples
